 NNYv3 0.3   (19 June 2010)

 NNYv3 0.3 - Roughly draft with the new ACE library

 ==== Server Features ====
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 ! IMPORTANT: We switched the whole project to the ACE library. So far it's the best choice I never did but it
 !            involved a complete rewrite of all classes. Here belows are the logs of what changed BEFORE the
 !            ACE update, meaning they arn't applicable anymore.
 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 * Added: Character list
 * Added: Deleting a character
 * Work-in-progress: Selecting a character and entering world (half done)
 * Implemented: MULTIPLE_LOGGING_ALLOWED parameter in world.conf
 
 ==== Client Features ====
 * As usual PHPTinyClient has been updated to the latest working server sources
 
 ==== Optimisation ====

 ==== Protocol Features ====
 * Added: PCKT_C_GETCHARLIST
 * Added: PCKT_W_CHARLIST_ADD
 * Added: PCKT_C_DELETE_CHAR
 * Added: PCKT_C_ENTER_WORLD
 * Added: PCKT_W_ENTER_WORLD_ACK (half done)
 
 ==== Portability ====
 * It was working before the ACE/Database class update, I have no idea now, maybe it just require a quick linking/makefile fix to work.

 NNYv3 0.2   (07 May 2010)

 NNYv3 0.2 - adds further improvements to the server core
 as well as to the majority of game classes.

 ==== Server Features ====
 * Modified: Updated ByteArray class to supports Adding/Reading ACK types
 * Added: New type 'ACK' wich is nothing more than a typedef BYTE
 * Added: Authentication now works properly and sends ACK reply.
 * Added: Database class for handling the MySQL connection
 
 ==== Client Features ====
 * Added: Login screen's working & it connects to servers

 ==== Optimisation ====
 * Removed: Commented unused vars in threadHandler
 * Fixed: Possible crash fixed in threadHandler
 
 ==== Protocol Features ====
 * Added: I implemented the so waited ACK packet replies
 * Removed: PCKT_C_AUTH, parameter "token" has been removed.
 * Removed: PCKT_R_CONNECT, parameter "token" has been removed.
 
 ==== Portability ====
 * Added: Linux support is now back with working Makefiles

 ---------------------------------------------------
 
NNYv3 0.1   (03 May 2010)
 
 NNYv3 0.1 - basic core that we will add further improvements.

 ==== Protocol Features ====
 * Added: PCKT_C_AUTH
 * Modified: PCKT_R_CONNECT, new parameter "token" has been added.
 
 ==== Server Features ====
 * Added: A token implementation, the token is obtained from the Realm server and must be given to the World server in PCKT_C_AUTH packet.
 * Added: In-Game packet; Authentification support (so capsuleHdl_auth has been added to the project).
 * Modified: capsuleHdl_default now prints what [WORD] is erroneous if the 'switch case' cannot handle the said capsule.
 * Modified: Typos & language error in the documentation.
 * Added: Some basic packets but nothing "in-game" yet sadly.
 * Added: Grid class that makes a big use of the HashTable and LinkedLists; also could be improved I think.
 * Added: HashTable class for the upcoming Grid class; it looks sufficient but it really could be improved.
 * Added: Thread pooling so the server response's time is way better and we avoid re-allocating memory. 
 * Modified: Templated ByteArray and working like a charm so far; big thanks Tombana.
 
 ==== Client Features ====
 * Modified: I updated my own testing client (PHPTinyClient) so it now works with our most recent version.
 
 ==== Portability ====
 * Removed: Even if the server is meant to be developed under Windows and run on a Linux machine, the Makefiles still aren't working at the moment.
 * Added: ZSocket portable class to handle packets on both linux & windows.
