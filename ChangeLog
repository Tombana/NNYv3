NNYv3 0.1   (03 May 2010)
 
 NNYv3 0.1 - basic core that we will add further improvements.

 ==== Protocol Features ====
 * Added: PCKT_C_AUTH
 * Modified: PCKT_R_CONNECT, new parameter "token" has been added.
 
 ==== Server Features ====
 * Added: A token implementation, the token is obtained from the Realm server and must be given to the World server in PCKT_C_AUTH packet.
 * Added: In-Game packet; Authentification support (so capsuleHdl_auth has been added to the project).
 * Modified: capsuleHdl_default now prints what [WORD] is erroneous if the 'switch case' cannot handle the said capsule.
 * Modified: Typos & language error in the documentation.
 * Added: Some basic packets but nothing "in-game" yet sadly.
 * Added: Grid class that makes a big use of the HashTable and LinkedLists; also could be improved I think.
 * Added: HashTable class for the upcoming Grid class; it looks sufficient but it really could be improved.
 * Added: Thread pooling so the server response's time is way better and we avoid re-allocating memory. 
 * Modified: Templated ByteArray and working like a charm so far; big thanks Tombana.
 
 ==== Client Features ====
 * Modified: I updated my own testing client (PHPTinyClient) so it now works with our most recent version.
 
 ==== Portability ====
 * Removed: Even if the server is meant to be developed under Windows and run on a Linux machine, the Makefiles still aren't working at the moment.
 * Added: ZSocket portable class to handle packets on both linux & windows.
