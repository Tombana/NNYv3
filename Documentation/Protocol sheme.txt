(Theses packets are subject to MAJOR modifications and must not
in any case be considered as their final version. It's just some
ideas I had on how we could implement things; nothing's sure yet
and I really am open to suggestions or improvements if it can makes
the engine better. ~NitriX)

(Tombana: For the movement/deplacement packets: what about just one PCKT_C_MOVEMENT and
then the next byte/word can specify what type of movement, like jump/wasd/turn and so on.
So kind a like a subcommand.)
