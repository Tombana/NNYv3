The 3D library:

You will need the Ogre3D SDK.

Download it from:
http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk

Attention!
Do not choose the newest version because it is not precompiled.
Choose the previous release instead: OGRE 1.6.5 SDK for Visual C++ .Net 2008 (9.0)

Guide for installing the SDK:

When you want to start a new project to experiment with Ogre, these are the settings you must set:

C/C++ : General : Additional Include Directories 	 = ..\include;$(OGRE_HOME)\include;$(OGRE_HOME)\samples\include
Linker : General : Additional Library Directories         = $(OGRE_HOME)\lib

(The following is for debug mode, in brackets there are the settings for release mode where appropriate)

Debugging : Command                                 = $(OutDir)\$(ProjectName).exe
Debugging : Working Directory                       = $(OutDir)
C/C++ : Code Generation : Use runtime library 	 = Multithreaded Debug DLL (Multithreaded DLL in Release)
Linker : General : Output File                            = ..\bin\Debug\[appname].exe
Linker : Input : Additional Dependencies                += OgreMain_d.lib OIS_d.lib  (OgreMain.lib OIS.lib in Release)
