Note: these are all the files and folders needed by the client.
pthreadVCE2.dll for the thread and mutex system and the rest is all for Ogre3D and CEGUI.
I've tried to remove stuff but this is really the minimum.
All files are needed, even the config files.
I think its nicer to have the config files implemented in the client but I couldn't figure out how to do that. Ogre always loads settings from the .cfg files.

So next to all these files we will also have all the graphic files, models, textures and so on.
