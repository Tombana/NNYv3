==How to compile on linux==

1) Install dependencies:
apt-get install make libpthread glibc(g++ compiler?) libmysqlclient15-dev(later)

2) make init
Create obj directory

3) make
Compile sources with g++

4) make clean
Delete obj directory

=> Alternatively, you can keep the obj directory. The most avantage is when you will update
SVN files (and use make command again), it will only re-compiles needed files :)

Have fun :]
